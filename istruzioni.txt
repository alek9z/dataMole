I added the py4j-x.x.x-src.zip and pyspark.zip under
$SPARK_HOME/python/lib to the project structure
(preferences > Project> Project Structure and then do "+ Add Content Root")
and it worked fine.

PS: Pycharm already had $PYTHONPATH and $SPARK_HOME read from the os env,
which was set in .bashrc/.bash_profile
